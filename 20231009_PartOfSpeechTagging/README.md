Part-of-speech tagging, often referred to as POS tagging, is a natural language processing technique that involves assigning grammatical categories or "parts of speech" (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) to each word in a given text. This process is crucial for understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of sentences, as it helps identify the role that each word plays within a sentence. POS tagging is widely used in various NLP applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval, to improve language understanding and enable more accurate linguistic analysis of text data.

Assigment:

In this context, the task is to modify and enhance the provided [input_viterbi.py](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231009_PartOfSpeechTagging/input_viterbi.py), which was given in the Introduction to NLP class, taught by Patrick Wang, to create a part-of-speech hidden Markov model (HMM).

For more details about the exercise, you can refer to the [assignment_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231009_PartOfSpeechTagging/assignment_instructions.pdf) file.
