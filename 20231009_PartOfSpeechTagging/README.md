**Part-of-speech tagging:**

Part-of-speech tagging or POS tagging, is a natural language processing technique that involves assigning grammatical categories or "parts of speech" (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) to each word in a given text. This process is crucial for understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of sentences, as it helps identify the role that each word plays within a sentence. POS tagging is widely used in various NLP applications.

**Hidden Markov Model**

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents a system which transitions between different states over time. The key characteristic of an HMM is that the states are not directly observable; instead, they generate observable symbols or observations. Each state has a probability distribution over possible observations, and the system transitions from one state to another based on transition probabilities. The Viterbi algorithm is used with HMMs to find the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observed symbols.

**Viterbi:**

The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) given a sequence of observations. It efficiently computes the maximum probability of a particular state sequence and is particularly useful in applications where the underlying states are not directly observable but can be inferred from observed data. The algorithm maintains a trellis or matrix of probabilities, calculating the most likely path to each state at each time step. By backtracking through the trellis, the algorithm identifies the optimal sequence of hidden states that best explains the observed data. Viterbi is widely employed in various fields, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics, for tasks where understanding the underlying sequence of states is crucial for accurate modeling and prediction.

The Viterbi algorithm is often applied in the context of POS tagging when POS tags are treated as hidden states in an HMM. It helps determine the most probable sequence of POS tags for a given sequence of observed words in a sentence, taking into account the inherent dependencies between POS tags and the likelihood of observing specific words given their POS tags.

**Assigment:**

In this context, the task is to modify and enhance the provided [input_viterbi.py](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231009_PartOfSpeechTagging/input_viterbi.py), which was given in the Introduction to NLP class, taught by Patrick Wang, to create a part-of-speech hidden Markov model (HMM).
