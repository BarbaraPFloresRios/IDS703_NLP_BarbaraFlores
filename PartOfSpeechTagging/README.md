Part-of-speech tagging, often referred to as POS tagging, is a natural language processing technique that involves assigning grammatical categories or "parts of speech" (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) to each word in a given text. This process is crucial for understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of sentences, as it helps identify the role that each word plays within a sentence. POS tagging is widely used in various NLP applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval, to improve language understanding and enable more accurate linguistic analysis of text data.

The objective of the assignment is to create a part-of-speech hidden Markov model (HMM) using the first 10,000 tagged sentences from the Brown corpus, where the components of the HMM include the transition matrix, observation matrix, and initial state distribution. This model should use the universal tagset and account for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or unknown words with appropriate smoothing techniques. The assignment also requires the preservation of mappings between states, observations, and indices.
