**Semantic Vectors:**

Semantic vectors" are numerical representations that capture the meaning of words, phrases, or documents in a vector space. These vectors are used in natural language processing to understand and measure semantic similarity between words or texts, which is crucial in tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, and machine translation.

**Assigment:**

In this context, the task is to modify and enhance the provided [input_document_vectors_experiment.py](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231101_SemanticVectors/input_document_vectors_experiment.py), which was given in the Introduction to NLP class, taught by Patrick Wang, to create a part-of-speech hidden Markov model (HMM).

For more details about the exercise, you can refer to the [assignment_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231101_SemanticVectors/%20assignment_instructions.pdf) file.

You can find my completed work for this project in [viterbi.py](https://github.com/BarbaraPFloresRios/IDS703_NLP_NaturalLanguageProcessing/blob/main/20231009_PartOfSpeechTagging/viterbi.py) file
