**Semantic Vectors:**

Semantic vectors" are numerical representations that capture the meaning of words, phrases, or documents in a vector space. These vectors are used in natural language processing to understand and measure semantic similarity between words or texts, which is crucial in tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, and machine translation.
